# Mock response validation

- Use the UI to validate each mock response against the schema.
- It's also possible to validate all responses by clicking "Validate all mock responses" in UI.
- In case of you using params (query or path params) in mock data, you can simulate them by adding an [".request_data.json"](/demo/rest/products/%23%7BproductCode%7D/GET/mock/.request_data.json) file.
